About
=======

parametricWallpaper.js is a small framework built on top of P5JS for easing the introduction to creative coding.
This project is a part of the Creative Coding Projects youtube channel.
The goal of CreativeCoding Projects is to make it easier to begin creating actual content whilst learning creative coding rather than having to suffer through a long period of learning the ropes before making anything actually fun.
For information on how to get started on this project visit: VIDEO URL GOES HERE

Installation
=======

  1. Download parametricWallpaper.zip from: https://github.com/CreativeCodingProjects/parametricWallpaperJS/releases/latest
  2. unzip it and put the unzipped folder in a sensible place on your computer
  3. if you don't already have a text editor get one (I recommend Atom as that is what I use in the videos)
  4. install a development server such as atom-live-server
  5. Watch the tutorial videos at: PLAYLIST URL GOES HERE

Build from source
=======

  You only need to do this if you are interested to making changes to the source, if you're new to code and only looking to do the project, follow the instructions in the "installation" section.

  1. clone the repo or download the zip
  2. install npm if you don't already have it
  3. npm install
  4. npm run Build

This will build the source and populate the build folder with the necessary libraries.
All the files you need can be found in the build folder, that will form the base folder of your project.
You will need to use a local development server to be able to use all the features in some browsers.
